        "\n",
        "For the results of Simple Linear Regression to be reliable and valid, several key assumptions about the data and the relationship between the variables must be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent variable ($x$) and the dependent variable ($y$) must be linear. This means that the data points should roughly follow a straight line when plotted.\n",
        "2.  **Independence of Errors:** The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. This means that the error for one observation should not be related to the error for any other observation. This assumption is often violated in time series data or when there are dependencies between observations.\n",
        "3.  **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors):** The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values. If the variance of the errors increases or decreases as the independent variable changes, it is called heteroscedasticity.\n",
        "4.  **Normality of Errors:** The errors (residuals) should be normally distributed. This means that if you were to plot a histogram of the residuals, it should resemble a bell curve. While this assumption is less critical for large sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem, it is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "5.  **No Multicollinearity (for multiple regression, but relevant to consider in SLR with dummy variables):** While strictly an assumption for multiple linear regression, it's worth noting that in SLR, the independent variable should not be perfectly correlated with any other variable in the model (though in SLR, there's only one independent variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "Violations of these assumptions can lead to biased estimates, incorrect standard errors, and invalid statistical inferences. It's important to check these assumptions when building and evaluating an SLR model."

        "Evaluating the performance of a regression model is crucial to understand how well it fits the data and makes predictions. Here are three common evaluation metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**\n",
        "    *   **Description:** MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the actual values and the predicted values. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.\n",
        "    *   **Formula:** $ MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i| $\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** A lower MAE indicates a better model performance. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**\n",
        "    *   **Description:** MSE is the average of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors due to the squaring.\n",
        "    *   **Formula:** $ MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 $\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** A lower MSE indicates a better model performance. It is more sensitive to outliers than MAE. The square root of MSE is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is often used because it is in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **R-squared ($R^2$) - Coefficient of Determination:**\n",
        "    *   **Description:** $R^2$ measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It indicates how well the regression model fits the observed data.\n",
        "    *   **Formula:** $ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST} $ where SSE is the sum of squared errors (residuals) and SST is the total sum of squares.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** $R^2$ ranges from 0 to 1. An $R^2$ of 0 means the model explains none of the variance in the dependent variable, while an $R^2$ of 1 means the model explains all of the variance. A higher $R^2$ generally indicates a better fit, but it's important to consider other metrics and the context of the problem.\n",

        "Here's a breakdown of its purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Goodness of Fit:** $R^2$ serves as an indicator of the \"goodness of fit\" of the regression model. A higher $R^2$ value suggests that the model fits the observed data better.\n",

        "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
        "    *   An $R^2$ of 0 means that the model explains none of the variability in the dependent variable.\n",

        "    *   An $R^2$ between 0 and 1 indicates the proportion of variance explained. For example, an $R^2$ of 0.75 means that 75% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that while a high $R^2$ is desirable, it doesn't necessarily mean the model is perfect or that there isn't a better model. $R^2$ can be influenced by the number of independent variables (especially in multiple regression), and it doesn't tell us about the validity of the model's assumptions or whether the relationships are causal. Therefore, $R^2$ should be considered along with other evaluation metrics and domain knowledge."
